      quote: "Rahul Vinod, whose family has run a restaurant in Washington, DC since his father immigrated in 1985, has long been passionate about showcasing the true diversity of Indian cuisine. Early on he’d introduce skeptical friends to his family’s dishes, and in high school he even won a business competition with a plan to make Indian food more accessible. After several years in New York corporate roles, he left his job to travel across India, reconnect with his heritage, and return home to launch RASA—a restaurant dedicated to sharing the authentic flavors and stories of his childhood."

      logo: HotglueLogo,
      companyDescription: "Hotglue is an embedded integration stack for high‑performing B2B teams.",
      quote: "David is a founder of hotglue, which helps SaaS companies offer integrations inside of their product, without their customer ever knowing. Outside of work, David is a soccer, pet (3 cats and a dog speak to that), and golf fanatic. When at UMD, AKPsi gave David a space to meet, collaborate, and learn from other students who had similar goals for their future - whether that be starting a company or achieving success in their own right. Lasting friendships and a quick lesson on how to write cold emails don’t hurt either."
